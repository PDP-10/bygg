First, there is a new version of backwr.  This new version supports input
files in ANSI-ASCII, with or without newline -> CRLF conversion, and also
files in CORE-DUMP format.  This last format may solve the problem people
have had with transferring binary files.

See ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/pdp10/backwr/

I have also made a slight modification to simh:

This implements, for the PDP10, a DEUNA (ethernet) card on the unibus.
The mod consists of the following files:

pdp10_deuna.c   - interface to the pdp10 emulator.
dec_deuna.c     - the actual card emulating code.
eth_dummy.c     - ethernet backend, as in /dev/null.
eth_bpf.c       - ethernet backend that talks bpf.

See ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/pdp10/simh-deuna/

I would right now label this code as early beta, but is has transferred
packets with some success, as in "the pdp10 has answerd arp queries".

There are many things still missing from the deuna code.

It should be an easy task to write pdp11_deuna.c, anyone interested?

The IP stack for Tops-10 is not yet in such a shape that I would label
it fit for human consumption.
