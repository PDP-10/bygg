Introductory Information 
*************************

This list contains detailed information on some of the available laser discs,
however, it is not possible to have a complete list. If you can provide 
information for titles which are not currently on this list, I and many other
readers would be most grateful for your input.

The information contained in this list is designed to supplement the Film
Availablilty List maintained by Tom Tanida by providing more detailed
information about the laserdisc titles. The Film Availability List is posted
occasionally to rec.arts.disney and is available via anonymous FTP from
yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au (130.194.9.1) under /pub/disney/ref/avail.gz or by 
e-mail from the maintainer.

Readers who are new to the world of Laserdiscs should obtain the set of
articles written by Bob Niland <rjn@csn.org>. Copies of these are available
via anonymous FTP from the following sites:

   ftp.csn.org (128.138.213.23), directory Laserdisc 
   princeton.edu (128.112.128.1), directory pub/Video/Niland 
   bobcat.bbn.com (128.89.2.103)

and for those of you in Europe:

The index file is LD00.

For a more general catalog of Disney LD releases, the "Disney Label LD
Releases" is available from Andrew Krieg <krieg.ct.med.ge.com>. This list
contains non-animated films from Disney as well as those from Touchstone and
Hollywood Pictures.

Please consult the Notational Information section toward the end of this
document for an explanation of entries.

The information contained in this document was collected from the actual
disks, the rec.arts.disney FAQ, the rec.arts.disney Film Availaibility List,
the announcements published by Image Entertainment and Pioneer LaserDisc
Corporation and contributions from the rec.arts.disney readers. Please
forward any corrections or new information to the maintainer 
<daviduy@ee.umr.edu>.



A SPECIAL NOTE TO COLLECTORS OF WALT DISNEY RELEASES
====================================================

Please carefully note the edition number of the title you have purchased
before opening the package to insure that it is the version you want. With
the exception of Robin Hood and the new Archive Collection versions (which
appear to have catalog number changes) all newer versions have an edition
number which is greater than one. You can find the edition number on the
back underneath the copyright notices. I have tried to indicate the most
current edition numbers in this list, however, there may be errors. To
differentiate between the different manufacturers, the jacket does have
the country of manufacture noted on the jacket also near the copyright
notices.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell between two manufacturers
in Japan or two in the US without inspecting the disk.

   NOTES: The completely live action scenes were shot in Academy Aperture
   and soft matted for the letterboxed version (the safe areas are included
   in the P&S version). Any sequences with cartoons were composed from the
   Academy prints of the live action sequences and the animation work onto
   film at 1.85:1, 1.75:1, or 1.66:1 which is fundamentally the letterboxed
   version.  (These sequences in the P&S version are panned and scanned from
   a theatrical aspect ratio print). The transitions between P&S and Academy
   Aperture in the P&S version are not noticable. 

   A survey card (HV7714) was included. 

   A report from AP on March 15, 1994 reported X-Rated scenes in some LD
   versions of this film. Because of the demand, the title was temporarily
   unavailable. The title has been re- printed without any known changes. 

   The edition change from 1 to 2 only involved a packaging change.

Reposting or cross-posting of this document is prohibited without the

Notational Information 
***********************

Manufacturers: 
   3M = Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Wisconsin, USA 
   DADC = Digital Audio Disc Corporation, Indiana, USA 
   Kuraray = Kurare, Japan 
   Mitsubishi = Mitsubishi, Japan 
   Pioneer = Pioneer Video Manufacturing, Japan 
   PVI = Pioneer Video Incorporated, California, USA 
   Technidisc = Technidisc, Michigan, USA 
   WEA = Warner-Electra-Asylum Manufacturing, Pennsylvania, USA 
   Japan/USA are indicated where the actual manufacturer has not yet been
   identified by inspection. 

Edition 
   This indicates the edition for which information has been provided. Every
   attempt has been made to provide the most recent edition, however, there
   may be errors. This is primarily for Disney titles where the edition is
   indicated on the packaging. 

CAV 
   Constant Angular Velocity (Standard Play) This disk format allows all
   players to freeze-frame, variable speed play-back, and clear scan any
   portion of the side pressed in this format. 

CLV 
   Constant Linear Velocity (Extended Play) This disk format does not support
   CAV effects unless you have a player with digital field memory. 

CX 
   Analog Noise Reduction System developed by CBS 

(surround) 
   Surround Matrix Encoded (non-Dolby) 

TOC 
   Table of Contents. This makes the LD look like a CD, providing timing data
   (and frame/time data if the disk is CAV) for each chapter as well as the
   whole disk. 

Chapter stops 
   Marks placed at appropriate locations on the disk which allow you to
   quickly go to a certain film or part of a film. NO CHAPTER STOPS means
   that you must either use the time/frame search option or visually search
   for the natural breaks on the disk. Disks with TOC will always have
   chapter stops. 

List price 
   is the one suggested by the distributor at the time of release in US
   Dollars or Japanese Yen. The actual market price may be different. 

Information in curly {} brackets has not been verified. 

For feature films (ONLY): 
   (For a detailed discussion on widescreen processes, please read the last
   section of this document). 

   Letterboxed (aspect ratio) = the film has been transferred to video format
      maintaining the aspect ratio (size) of the original negative or
      theatrical print. 

   Academy Aperture = The original negative or theatrical print has an aspect
      ratio very close to that of the television. No letterboxing or panning
      and scanning are needed for this type of film. 

   P&S = The video camera is zoomed in on the original picture and moved
      within the frame. This fills the video screen, however, the part of the
      picture at the sides is lost. 

   Matted = The camera used to make the film captures the TV aspect ratio,
      however, the director and cameraman use a viewfinder that is masked to
      a widescreen format. The final print is masked to give the effect of
      being shot with a scope camera. The videos made from this type of film
      are generally transferred from the original negative in academy
      aperture, however, if the video from this type of film is in letterbox
      format, then it will be identified as a matted film. 

   If not noted the original aspect ratio is unknown. 

CROPPING EVIDENT 
   Means that the effects of a P&S process are visible, most likely some part
   of the title or ending credits have been lopped off at the sides. 

HOCE 
   Horizontal Optical Compression Evident. In order to transfer the title
   sequence completely from a widescreen image, the picture is compressed
   optically in the horizontal direction. This makes the letters and the
   background appear taller and thinner than originally intended. 

OUT OF PRINT 
   Means you will probably not be able to find this title for sale at the
   retail price. 

IN MORATORIUM 
   Means that the distributing company has stopped producing this title and
   will not press anymore copies once current stocks are depleted. (It's out
   of print, but you can still find copies of them at the retail price). 

dual-language 
   For Japanese imports, the original English soundtrack is provided on the
   Digital Soundtrack and the dubbed Japanese soundtrack is on the Analog
   Soundtrack. You must have a player with Digital Sound playback to listen
   to the English soundtrack. 




Cut-Out Report 
***************

Cut-Outs are items which the distributing company is attempting to clear out
of stock by selling it at a drastically reduced price. The disks themselves
are the same ones you would purchase at the regular price, however, to 
differentiate between the two, a hole is often drilled through the jacket, or
a slot is cut out of a corner. This prevents the purchaser from returning the
item to a store for a full-price refund and prevents the retailer from
returning the product to the distributor for credit. Warranties on defective
disks still hold for these disks.

The following editions have been spotted in cut-out bins since I started
keeping records in early 1992.

Wide Screen Film Processes 
***************************

     compiled by David Uy 
     February 18, 1995

     The copyrights of the material contained in this section are maintained
     by their respective owners.

     This section contains technical information on many of the common
     photographic processes used to make wide-screen, wide-frame and wide-
     gauge films.  Disney has been credited with using one 70mm format, three 
     anamorphic 35mm processes, two matte sizes, and academy aperture for
     its films, however, because there is currently considerable confusion 
     over the various processes and a lack of available information, I am 
     including most of the relavent points for other film processes which 
     will be encountered outside of the Disney domain.  It is not necessary 
     for you to have this section to understand the main entries of the LD
     supplement.

     The material in this document does not mention the Laserdisc medium
     directly.  This is because the definition of aspect ratio, with respect
     to this supplement, is in terms of the original source material; in 
     this case photographic film.  Understand that the original aspect ratio
     cannot be determined accurately either from a video source or from a
     theatrical projection because either can be improperly cropped.

     Academy Aperture - The standard ratio of 1.33:1 which represents the 
                        image area of a normally photographed image on a 
                        35mm print using spherical lenses.

     Anamorphic - As used in this document, the anamorphic process is a
                  distortion free compression process which squeezes the 
                  horizontal image information by some specified factor 
                  while leaving the vertical image information alone.  
                  A special set of lenses must be used to reverse the 
                  process.

     Aspect Ratio: The normalized ratio of physical image width to physical
                   image height after decompression (if required).

     Blowup - See the Panavision 70 entry under 70mm formats.

     Cropping - Selective deleting of part of the image on the edges.

     Hard Matte - The image is filmed with the aspect ratio mask used in
                  the camera itself.  There is no safe area in this process.
                  Techniscope uses a hard matte.

     Matting - As used in this document, this is the process designed by
               filmmakers to simulate the anamorphic process by taking a 
               spherically filmed image and cropping the top and bottom, 
               usually in equal amounts, to obtain a desired aspect ratio.

     Magoptical soundtrack - A compromise soundtrack incorporating both
                             magnetic stripes and the standard optical track.
                             This allowed the prints to be played using 
                             monophonic equipment (optically based) and 
                             stereophonic equipment (magnetic/optical).
                             Because the magnetic striping was prone to 
                             damage, this system was eventually replaced by 
                             optically based stereo variable area soundtracks.
                             70mm formats still use magnetic striping on film.

     Print - Used to describe the collection of film footage which makes up 
             a complete film.

     Pulldown - The number of perforations which are pulled through the camera
                or projector after each frame.  A horizontal pulldown is used 
                to call attention to the horizontal orientation of the film and 
                camera or projector mechanism.

     Safe Area - The area on a spherically filmed image which is intended to
                 be cropped in a matting process.  This area is not intended 
                 to be seen by the audience and may contain shots of micro-
                 phones and other equipment.  A scene which includes the safe
                 area may not appear as the close-up shot the director 
                 intended to show.

     Soft Matte - A print which is created by matting an image filmed in a
                  larger image size is soft matted.  The safe area is
                  available for use in this process.  Superscope uses a soft
                  matte process.

     Spherical - As used in this document, spherically processed films are
                 those made with lenses which do not compress the image.  
                 This does not mean that the lenses do not cause distortion.

     Stereo Variable Area - A dual optical soundtrack system consisting of
                            a left and right channel which remains compatable
                            with the old RCA Photophone track (The center or
                            mono channel is the combination of the two).
                            Surround information is on the left and right
                            tracks but out of phase.  The surround information
                            and noise reduction is processed using Dolby or
                            similar vendor equipment and is monophonic.

     Three-Panel - A filming method using three synchronized cameras and
                   projectors to create one very large image.

     List of Disney films made in 35mm using spherical optics

     Academy Aperture Films

        The following pictures were released in Academy Aperture because 
        the date of release preceeds December 1952, the date of introduction 
        of the modern anamorphic process.  Although a few films were released 
        using some early form of widescreen process, Disney is not cited 
        as being a pioneer in the field.

           The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949)
           Alice in Wonderland (1951)
           Bambi (1942)
           Cinderella (1950)
           Dumbo (1941)
           Fantasia (1940)
           Fun and Fancy Free (1949)
           Make Mine Music (1946)

           So Dear to my Heart (1949)
           Song of the South (1946)
           The Three Caballeros (1945)

        NOTE: Peter Pan is included on this list because it is believed that 
        production on this film would have started prior to the interest in 
        moving off academy aperture.  


     Matted to an aspect ratio of approximately 1.66:1

        The current line of feature animation appears to be composed at a
        ratio of 1.66:1.  The images are usually presented between 1.66:1 to
        1.85:1 depending on the theater.

           Aladdin (1992)
           Beauty and the Beast (1991)
           The Lion King (1994)
           The Rescuers Down Under (1990)


     Matted to an aspect ratio of 1.75:1

        The following films are being assigned the aspect ratio of 1.75:1 
        which has been cited as being Disney's adopted matting ratio for 
        movies shot using spherical lenses between c1955 and at least 1984.  
        This ratio was adopted by Disney while the rest of the movie industry 
        set 1.85:1 as its standard.  

           The Absent Minded Professor (1960)
           The Aristocats (1970)
           Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959)
           Escape to Witch Mountain (1975)
           The Fox and the Hound (1981)
           The Great Mouse Detective (1986)
           Herbie Rides Again (1970)
           In Search of the Castaways (1962)
           Island at the Top of the World (1974)
           The Jungle Book (1967)
           Kidnapped (1960)
           Lady and the Tramp (1955) #

           The Sword in the Stone (1963)
           That Darn Cat (1965)

        NOTE: Lady and the Tramp was filmed simultaneously in anamorphic
        CinemaScope and Spherical formats.  


     Matted to an aspect ratio of 1.85:1

          The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993)
          Angels in the Outfield (1994)
          Blank Check (1994)

     Technirama 

         The film in the camera also passes horizontally for this process.
         The frame size is identical to a standard 35mm still camera people
         use to take pictures.  No soundtrack stripes were placed on the 
         Technirama film area.  The difference between Technirama and 
         VistaVision is the former uses an anamorphic compression during 
         filming where the latter uses spherical lenses.

     Super Technirama 70 

         The camera and negative process is identical to regular Technirama.
         The final release prints, however, are issued on 70mm stock.  
         Because the negative is on 35mm stock and uses anamorphic 
         compression, it is classified under the 35mm formats.

     Panavision 70

         Original anamorphic 35mm negatives are printed to 70mm film.  The
         process is called a 70mm Blowup.  Use of the Panavision 70 name was
         discontinued in the middle 1970's and advertised as 70mm films.
         Some films were incorrectly advertised as Super Panavision 70
         (Most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind).  Spherical
         format films were often blown up to ratios of 1.66:1, 1.75:1 or
         1.85:1.

         Omnimax uses a wide angle lens to project the image onto a dome
         screen.  Imax and Omnimax systems are compatable, except for artistic
         composition differences related to the concave screen.

     Cinerama three-panel 

         You may note there is little difference between the aspect ratios
         of these three-panel processes and that of Ultra Panavision 70 or
         MGM Camera 65.  In fact, MGM later capitalized on the use of other
         70mm formats to simulate the three panel process.  The significant
         difference is the use of a curved screen as opposed to a standard
         flat screen.  It is unfortunate that this curved screen effect 
         cannot be reproduced using currently available video technology.

     Super Cinerama notes
        MGM became involved in the Cinerama process in 1960.  A few films
        were issued using the Super Cinerama three panel process, notably 
        "The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" (1962) and "How the West
        was Won" (1963).

        The second update to the Super Cinerama system is called 70mm Super
        Cinerama which used the curved screen of Cinerama, but projected an
        Ultra Panavision 70 ("It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" (1963),
        "Battle of the Bulge" (1965), "The Greatest Story Ever Told" (1965),
        etc.), Super Panavision 70/Todd AO ("2001: A Space Odyssey"
        (1968)), Super Technirama 70, Superpanorama 70, Kinopanorama, or
        Panavision 70 film from a single projector with special optics to
        fit the picture onto the screen. 
  
        The third update made the curve screen 120 degrees with a non-louvered
        surface.  All these films were shot using spherical lenses in 70mm 
        format.  The same Cinerama enlarging lenses were used on the 
        projectors.
