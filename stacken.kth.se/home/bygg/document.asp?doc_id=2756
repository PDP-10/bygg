                         Vendors Fall for Pigeon Prank
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   When European carrier KPNQwest BV (Nasdaq: KQIP; Amsterdam: KNQST)
   called for bids for backbone router equipment last November, Juniper
   Networks Inc. (Nasdaq: JNPR) ended up getting the contract. But Cisco
   Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO) got the joke.
   
   The joke was embedded in a request for proposal (RFP) put out by
   KPNQwest. The carrier added a spoof Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) RFC (request for comment) to the documents, and asked vendors
   whether they supported it.
   
   The RFC in question -- RFC 2549 IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of
   Service -- is an update of RFC 1149, which describes the use of
   carrier pigeons in technical jargon. The update extends this to
   include, among other things, bulk transfer by ostrich.
   
   Responses revealed that a fair proportion of vendors will say they
   support a standard without having any idea of what the standard is
   about, much less whether they really support it.
   
   Thats pretty much what most people suspected -- and sometimes it's
   what carriers deserve, because they often seem to demand support for
   standards that arent really of any use to them, according to vendors.
   
   KPNQwest certainly caught some vendors napping with its little jape,
   described by Ronald E. van der Breggen, KPNQwests senior director of
   IP network development, at IIR's Telecom Transmission Networking 2000
   conference in Barcelona last week.
   
   In their submissions to KPNQwest, several vendors said they supported
   these RFCs, according to van der Breggen, who declines to name the
   birdbrains. A few vendors, Juniper being one of them, simply noted
   that the RFC wasnt serious. Cisco was the only one to respond in an
   appropriate vein by writing only on April 1 against the RFC in
   question.
