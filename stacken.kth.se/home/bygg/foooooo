Stacken does not have any PDP10 stuff any more.  Some of the people in
the club are still very much into the PDP10 game, but emulated ones.

A long time ago, stacken had a large collection of PDP10 stuff, but there
was a fallout between the club and one of the members, Peter, who was at
the time also the owner of a lot of the PDP10 stuff, but not all of it.

There was a divorce of somewhat nuclear proportions, and the end result
was that Peter got custody of most of the PDP10 stuff, and he moved it
into storage, where I beleive it still is.  I still have a couple of KS10
systems and some stuff, but nothing bigger.  They are in runnable condition
(I hope, they were when last powered down) but there is nowhere to run them
at the moment.

Summary: There should still exist, in a dusty storage area somewhere, a
rather large collection of stuff, KA, KI, KL etc, including about one
hundred RP06's, a BBN pager, a KL-UDGE, etc.

It's a shame.
