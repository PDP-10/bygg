Tommy,
This is MUD! The file READ.MUD is a short note from Richard Bartle.
The .MAS files are the source, in compressed format - use the SUBFIL
program to unpick them. However, it is all written in Essex BCPL, which
we sell under licence, so if you don't have it, let me know + I'll 
arrange for licence forms to be sent to you. It isn't expensive - I
think 50 pounds for academic institutions - but we try to avoid 
piracy if possible.
Enjoy your game!
Rick.
