Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a legislator,
I'd be interested in this mystery-- for the same reason that, if I were a farmer
and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night, I'd
want to go out and investigate. Hackers are not stupid, and unanimity is very
rare in this world. So if they're all squawking, perhaps there is something
amiss.
