                     San Francisco Restaurant Information
                                       
   Do you constantly run into your fellow convention goers at dinner?
   Are you concerned you're getting ripped off by restaurants that serve
   low quality food?
   Do you feel that you've just stayed five days in a city and know
   nothing more about it than when you arrived?
   If you answered "yes" to these questions you are suffering from
   conventionitis.
   Don't let that happen to you in San Francisco, a city where high
   prices are the norm and outragious prices are what YOU THE TOURIST
   PAY.  When you eat near the hotels you are largely paying the real
   estate bill of those restaurants being near the hotels.  The
   restaurants in the area of the hotel are nearly all lousy and
   overpriced.
   Here are some of my favorite restaurants.  If you don't see a genre
   here, that certainly doesn't mean San Francisco lacks it.  It just
   means I haven't eaten there.

Steak Houses

   Izzy's Steak House
   3345 Steiner St. ; Marina District; Tel 563-0488
   
   This is an old San Francisco haunt with really good prime rib, and
   excellent creamed spinach.  They have nearly every steak sauce ever
   made.
   $$
   
   House of Prime Rib
   1906 Van Ness Ave; Polk Gulch; Tel 885-4605
   
   Guess what they serve?   And they do a good job of it.

Italian

   Acquerello
   1722 Sacramento St; base of Russian Hill; Tel  415-567-5432
   
   Best italian restaurant in the city.  http://www.acquerello.com/
   Reservations required.  No tee-shirts or jeans.
   $$$$
   
   Cafe Riggio
   4112 Geary Boulevard; Richmond District; Tel 221-2114
   
   This is good north-italian, with a wide variety of dishes from pasta
   to fish to meat.
   $$
   
Vietnamese

   Golden Turtle
   2211 Van Ness Ave; Tel 441-4419
   
   Very tasty.
   $$
   
Vegetarian

   Joubert's
   4115 Judah Street; Outer Sunset; Tel 753-5448
   
   This South African restaurant features all vegetarian and optionally
   vegan cuisine.  For vegetarians who are looking for something other
   than tofu, here's an interesting alternative.  Please note that
   Joubert's is a bit out of the way.  You'll need a taxi, and it will
   take about 15 minutes from the hotel.  If you have a whole lot of time
   you can take the N Judah muni line.
   $$
   
   Greens
   Fort Mason; Tel 771-6222
   
   Greens is the premiere vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco.  Their
   daily menus change, but their food is always tasty.  Particularly
   their hazelnut chocolate mousse dessert.  They also have a fairly full
   wine list to choose from.
   $$$
   
   Nee Cha
   2100 Sutter Street; Pacific Heights/Western Edition; Tel 922-9419
   
   This restaurant has a full vegetarian menu, and has all your favorite
   thai hits.

Japanese

   Ebisu
   1283 9th Ave; Inner Sunset; Tel  566-1770
   
   This is one of San Francisco's most popular sushi restaurants.
   Delicious sushi at reasonable prices, Ebisu features some off the wall
   soups and fish, aside from the usual selection one might find
   elsewhere.  But here's the bonus- if you don't get out to Ebisu and
   still want a sushi fix, there's one IN SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL
   AIRPORT!  Located in the International terminal outside of security,
   they don't offer as large a selection as their sibling restaurant, but
   it is better than any other airport food you'll get.
   $$
   
   Shimo
   2339 Clement St.; Outer Richmond; Tel 752-4422
   
   I didn't have to look up the phone number for this one.  Shimo is my
   local haunt.  Great fish, reasonable prices.  For non-sushi eaters,
   Shimo also has great hot food.
   $$
   
Chinese

   Eliza's
   1457 18th Street; Potrero Hill; Tel 648-9999
   
   This restaurant has the attraction of not only being a very tasty
   chinese restaurant, but it also has an excellent selection of
   vegetarian cuisine.  Try the veggy spring rolls, but look out for the
   mustard; it's hot!
   $
   
   Harbor Village
   Embargaderro Center 4, 2nd floor; Tel 781-8833
   
   One of the top ten chinese restaurants according to KTVU, there is in
   my opinion no better dim sum in the city.  This is the only restaurant
   on the list that is both in walking distance, and preferred for
   lunch.  This is a particularly fine choice if you've gotten in a day
   early, and are looking for a different sort of Sunday brunch.

French

   Zazie
   941 Cole St.; Cole Valley; Tel 564-5332
   
   Zazie is downscale french, meaning you don't pay through the nose.  My
   particular favorite is their fish soup provencale.
   $$
   
   Chapeau!
   1408 Clement St; Outer Richmond;  Tel 750-9787
   
   This one you almost pay through the nose for, but the food and service
   are excellent.  Definitely stick around for the desserts.  This
   restaurant typifies something in San Francisco: good restaurants can
   be found in just about any neighborhood.
   $$$
   
   Hyde Street Bistro
   1521 Hyde St;  Russian Hill; Tel  292-4415
   
   Excellent quality fish dishes.  I particularly like their fish soup
   provencale. Great service and great desserts.  This one you can take
   the Hyde St. cable car to, but there will be no parking, so don't take
   a car.
   $$$
   
Others

   The Cliff House
   1090 Point Lobos Blvd; Point Lobos; Tel 386-3330
   
   This is one of those San Francisco institutions that provides pretty
   good cuisine and a fine view of the Pacific ocean.  This is actually
   Cliff House #4, as the first 3 fell down.  There used to be an arcade
   museum below it, but I believe it is closed.  If you look north of
   restaurant you can see the ruins of the old Sutro baths.  To be sure,
   you're paying for views at the Cliff House, which means sunset is the
   best time to eat there.
