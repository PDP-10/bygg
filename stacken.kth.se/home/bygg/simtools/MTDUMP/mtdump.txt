mtdump dumps the record structure of a tape image file in .tap format.

.tap format tape images have the format

	4 byte record length 1
	record 1
	repeat of 4 byte record length 1
	4 byte record length 2
	record 2
	repeat of 4 byte record length 2
	:
	4 bytes = 00000000 for end of file

and so on.  This is the tape format expected by simh, Tim Stark's TS10,
and John Wilson's E11.

mtdump is invoked by

	mtdump file1 file2 file3...

Output is to stdout, unless redirected.
