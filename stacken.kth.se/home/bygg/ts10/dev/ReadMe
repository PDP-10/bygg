Device routines for disk, tape, ethernet, printer, serial, etc..

This RH11 Controller routines are under developement and not finished yet.
They should be compatible for all PDP-10, PDP-11, and VAX-11 emulators here.

Ethernet, serial, printer, etc units are being implemented later.  I still
am looking for Ethernet specifications (NI1010/NI2010, DE-series, etc..),
MSCP/TMSCP specifications, Q22-Bus (for VAX), etc...
