VAX emulator v0.2a Pre-Alpha

This VAX emulator is under developement at this time.  I currently am
developing this emulator in progress.

I am starting to develop VAX emulator as MicroVAX II series.  Later models
will be added like VAX-11/780, VAX 8650, etc.

I am looking for more device specifications to complete the VAX emulators
with wide devices includes tape, ethernet, etc.  Only I have knowledge
of RH11 controller and its MASSBUS drives specifications at this time 
(for PDP-10 emulator).  Also, I need Q-bus specification for MicroVAX II.

When you develop your desired device handling routines, please include
complete specification documents as much as possible so that other developers
and I can understand how they work clearly.

I have a copy of VAX Aritecture Handbook (1st edition - 1987) and VAX Internal
and Data Sturctures Handbook.  I am looking for a copy of 2nd edition (1991)
for complete vector instructions and other latest models.

Also, I am looking for a copy of MicroVAX II technical manual about local
I/O access like console terminal, etc.

Thank you!
